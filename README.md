# XitiqueApp

## A Digital Solution for Community Savings and Financial Tracking

Welcome to the **XitiqueApp** repository. This project aims to digitize and streamline the traditional practice of **"Xitique"**, focusing on supporting local businesspeople and simplifying financial tracking.



## 🚀 Introduction

**XitiqueApp** is a forthcoming mobile application built with **Flutter**, accompanied by a robust backend API: **xitique.API**. This project is under active development and represents the first step in transforming a longstanding family-run financial process into an efficient, scalable digital solution.

> ⚠️ While the project is **not open-source**, the repository is publicly accessible for transparency and insight into its development.



## 🎯 The Problem & Our Solution

Our family has long managed a manual system to collect and track financial contributions from local businesspeople. This involved paper records and personal visits, leading to:

- Inefficient tracking
- Human errors
- Lack of real-time visibility

**XitiqueApp** addresses these issues by:

- 📱 **Digitalizing Collection & Registration**  
  Replacing paper logs with a secure, mobile-based platform.

- 📊 **Streamlining Tracking**  
  Clear, digital records accessible by both collectors and contributors.

- 📢 **Enhancing Communication**  
  In-app messages, reminders, and end-of-month payout notifications.



## 🔄 How It Works (Current vs. Future)

**Current Process:**

1. Collector visits vendors.
2. Contributions are manually logged in a notebook.
3. At month’s end, the collected total is returned.
4. A small daily fee is paid as service.

**Future with XitiqueApp:**

- ✅ **Mobile Collection Interface**  
  Collectors can log contributions instantly via the app.

- ✍️ **Digital Counter-signing**  
  Businesspeople digitally confirm deposits (replacing "X" marks).

- 📈 **Automated Tracking**  
  Daily contributions, monthly totals, and fees tracked automatically.

- 🔔 **Smart Notifications**  
  Reminders, payout alerts, and summaries via app/email.
